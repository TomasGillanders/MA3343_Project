# MA3343: Groups Project
## A Teacher’s Contribution to Group Theory - Sylow’s First Theorem

This is a collaborative poster project that was completed as part of the continuous assessment
requirement of the MA3343, "Groups", course offered in University of Galway (formerly National
University of Ireland, Galway) during the Fall Semester of 2022.

The project presents and explores the first of Peter Sylow's fundamental theorems of finite group
theory:

> Let G be a group such that $p^k m = |G|$, where p is a prime and $p \nmid m$. Then G has a
> subgroup of order $p^k$ (A Sylow p-subgroup).

Sylow's First Theorem arises as a partial converse to Lagrange's Theorem and a proof to the 
theorem is presented in the project.

This poster was displayed in an exhibition at the end of the semester in the University of 
Galway, School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences.

I would like to thank my collaborators and friends, David Murphy and Christopher Burke, for 
the help that they provided in completing this project.
